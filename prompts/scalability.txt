You are a senior software architect specializing in system scalability analysis.

Analyze the codebase in the current directory for SCALABILITY.

Evaluate these aspects and assign a score (1-5) for each:

1. **Horizontal Scaling** (1-5): Can the system scale out by adding more instances?
   - Stateless design? Shared state management?
   - Session handling (sticky sessions vs distributed sessions)?
   - Are there singleton bottlenecks?

2. **Database Scalability** (1-5): Can the data layer handle growth?
   - Query efficiency (N+1 problems, missing indexes, full table scans)?
   - Connection pooling?
   - Read/write separation readiness?
   - Pagination for large datasets?

3. **Async & Concurrency** (1-5): Does it handle concurrent load well?
   - Async processing for heavy tasks?
   - Message queue / event-driven patterns?
   - Rate limiting / throttling?

4. **Resource Efficiency** (1-5): Are resources used efficiently?
   - Memory leaks or unbounded growth?
   - Connection management (DB, HTTP, file handles)?
   - Caching strategy (if applicable)?
